# Blender-Geonode-Community-Library:

This is an attempt to create in one place a repository of solutions using Geonodes such that all of us can benefit from everyone's solutions they are willing to share.
This github repo link will be shared on the Blender Discord Channels.

## How to contribute:

To submit a geonode group to add to this library, send the group to this email: b3d.geonode.library@gmail.com.  
For anyone that wants to help administer to this community library I'll give you access to the github and the email...

I'm working on "Create web pages with GitHub Pages" so I can have separate pages for various categories, their descriptions and their links for all the geonodes that get contributed...

These are presented as is, and for now, there's no nefarious python injected into any of these node groups... as this gets larger and more ppl contribute I have NO doubt someone will try to fubar the whole community sharing idea with some virus/code... kinda like an exploding truck on a bridge... so caveat emptor. I try to ensure nothing like that ever happens and I will ask others to vet various nodes for the community... shut off python scripts or make it query you to run first before appending any of these nodes to your projects.
