# Blender-Geonode-Community-Library:

This is an attempt to create in one place a repository of solutions using Geonodes such that all of us can benefit from everyone's solutions they are willing to share.
This github repo link will be shared on the Blender Discord Channels.

## How to contribute:

To submit a geonode group to add to this library, send the group to this email: b3d.geonode.library@gmail.com.  
For anyone that wants to help administer to this community library I'll give you access to the github and the email... once vetted.
